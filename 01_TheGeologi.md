# The Geological History of South America: Twitch Plays

Welcome back to Comprehensive History of South America. Today, we're diving deep into the geological history of this continent. We've got a special guest with us today - the renowned astrophysicist, Neil deGrasse Tyson. 

South America's geological history is a fascinating journey which started about 6 million years ago. The continent underwent several tectonic and geological changes in this time. From drifting away from Africa, South America has seen volcanic activity, upliftment, erosion, and glaciation. 

Through Neil's extensive knowledge and understanding of earth and the universe, we will try to comprehend and interpret the various geological events that have led to the formation of the present-day South America. 

Did you know that there was a time when a seaway ran from the Pacific to the Atlantic oceans, separating the continent into two land masses? Or that the Andes, which runs from Venezuela to Argentina, is the longest continental mountain range in the world? 

So sit tight and join us in exploring the geological structures and formations that make South America unique. Let's travel back in time and uncover the mysteries of South America together with Neil deGrasse Tyson on Twitch Plays.

# The Frankenstein story: The Geological History of South America

Welcome to a special edition of Comprehensive History of South America where we bring history to life with Twitch Plays. Today, we are going to explore the geological history of South America with our special guest, Neil deGrasse Tyson.

As we travel back in time, we come across a fascinating story of how South America was formed over 6 million years ago. It all started when South America drifted away from Africa, creating the South Atlantic Ocean. The adventurous continent continued its journey, creating a seaway that separated it into two major land masses. 

As we continue our Twitch Plays journey through time, we see volcanic activity that led to the formation of the Andes mountain range - the longest in the world! But that's not all. We also see how the forces of upliftment, erosion, and glaciation have shaped South America into what it is today.

But as fascinating as this journey is, we also come across a Frankenstein story. In our story, a group of overzealous scientists decided to create an experiment in the Andes which would harness the powers beneath the mountains. The experiment went wrong and the pressure from the earth's mantle was unleashed, causing an earthquake that triggered a massive landslide. The landslide was so big that it altered the course of a river, causing flooding in the surrounding areas. 

As we witness this Frankenstein story unfold, we realize the importance of understanding and respecting the geological history of South America. It is not something that should be taken lightly. It has shaped the continent over millions of years, and any experimentation or disturbance could be disastrous.

The resolution of our story comes in the form of a message from Neil deGrasse Tyson. He reminds us that the forces of nature are strong and that we must respect them. He also emphasizes the importance of understanding South America's geological history, not just for the sake of history, but also for the sake of our future.

And with that, we conclude our journey through the geological history of South America. Join us next time on Comprehensive History of South America - Twitch Plays, as we explore more fascinating stories and history on this amazing continent.

In conclusion, the geological history of South America is a fascinating journey that started over 6 million years ago. South America has undergone various geological changes, from drifting away from Africa to volcanic activity, upliftment, erosion, glaciation, and the formation of the Andes mountain range. 

Through our special guest Neil deGrasse Tyson, we learned the importance of understanding and respecting the forces of nature that have shaped the continent over millions of years. As demonstrated in our Frankenstein story, any experimentation or disturbance of the natural environment could have disastrous consequences.

It's vital to learn from the past to ensure our future. By understanding the geological history of South America, we gain insights into how the continent has evolved and how it is likely to change in the future. 

Join us next time on Comprehensive History of South America - Twitch Plays, as we continue our exploration of the history, culture, and heritage of this incredible continent.
