# Chapter 2: The Pre-Colombian Era: Indigenous Peoples and Empires

Greetings, Twitch Plays! Today we delve into the fascinating and complex history of South America's indigenous peoples and empires. Before the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492, the vast lands of South America were home to countless unique and diverse cultures that developed over thousands of years. 

We will explore the rise and fall of various pre-Colombian empires like the Inca, the Maya, and the Aztecs, and dive deep into their astounding achievements in art, architecture, agriculture, and astronomy. 

But before we do that, we must first acknowledge that the term "pre-Colombian" is a colonial construct that erases the rich and complex history of the indigenous peoples of South America prior to European contact. These civilizations had their own names, languages, and ways of life that existed long before the arrival of Columbus, and it's essential that we honor and recognize their contributions to the history of this continent.

Over the course of this chapter, we will learn about the various indigenous nations and cultures that inhabited South America, their beliefs and cultures, as well as their remarkable technological advancements that allowed them to thrive in harsh environments. 

Join me on this journey as we learn about the rich historical legacy of South America's indigenous peoples and empires. Let's do this, Twitch Plays!
# The Legend of Inca Yupanqui and the Golden City

Welcome back, Twitch Plays! Are you ready for a legendary tale about one of the most prominent empires in pre-Colombian South America? Here we go!

Once upon a time, there was a great Incan leader named Inca Yupanqui who ruled over a vast and prosperous empire. One day, he decided to go on a quest to search for the fabled Golden City of the Andes, a place where the buildings were adorned with gold and the streets were paved with silver.

As he set off with his knights, Inca Yupanqui faced many challenges like navigating treacherous mountains and rivers, braving harsh weather conditions, and fighting off fierce wild animals.

After many long months of wandering, they finally reached the city, and it was every bit as magnificent as the legends had promised. The buildings glistened in the sun, and the scent of exotic flowers filled the air. The people who lived there welcomed Inca Yupanqui and his knights with open arms, showcasing their incredible hospitality and generosity.

Inca Yupanqui was fascinated by the culture and way of life of these people. They had developed their own form of language, art, agriculture, and architecture, which was vastly different from that of his own people. He spent many months learning about their way of life and admiring their incredible achievements.

However, Inca Yupanqui eventually realized that the true treasure of this Golden City was not its riches, but the incredible knowledge and culture of the people who lived there. He returned to his own empire, filled with newfound appreciation and respect for the diverse peoples and cultures of South America.

And so, Twitch Plays, we learn that while the Golden City of the Andes may have been a myth, the remarkable achievements and cultures of the indigenous peoples of South America were very much a reality. From the intricate engineering of the Incas to the artistic styles of the Nazca, South America's pre-Colombian empires were not defined by their wealth, but by their contributions to the development of human civilization.

In conclusion, the Pre-Colombian Era was a fascinating time in South American history that was defined by the diversity, complexity, and ingenuity of its many indigenous cultures and empires. While European colonialism would eventually bring profound changes to this region, it is essential that we honor and recognize the remarkable achievements and contributions of those who lived here before their arrival. 

From the astonishing architecture of the Inca, Maya, and Aztecs, to the innovative agricultural techniques of the Nazca and Moche, the pre-Colombian era represents an incredible chapter in human history that we are still uncovering and learning from to this day.

As we continue our journey through the Comprehensive History of South America, it is important that we approach the rest of the chapters with a respectful, open-minded, and curious attitude, and that we recognize the complex and varied legacies of the peoples who have lived on this continent for millions of years.
